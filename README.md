# Caesar-3.0
 Ceaser 1.0 just changed numbers, upercase letters, and lowercase letters within their own individual section
 ceaser 2.0 made it so that numbers, upercase letters, and lowercase letters could change to become echother when the shift was applied. I used AI to help me build a code that would work
 ceaser 3.0 carried over the basic principles, using McGarrah's code but instead of deciphering with a number previoulsy given, It ran through all possible shifts to decode the encrypted message and the person has to check them all to see which one is words
 My thinking didn't change very much over the project
